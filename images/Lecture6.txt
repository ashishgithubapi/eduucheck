    // Instantiating the request object
    request.open("GET", "https://reqres.in/api/users");
    request.onreadystatechange = function() {        
        if(this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200) {
            var responseData = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
            resolve(responseData);
            
        }
    };
    // Sending the request to the server
    request.send();
    
});

    console.log(res, 'promise resolved');
})

    console.log('dfdf')
